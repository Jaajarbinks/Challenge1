In this challenge for Horiseon, I made this html and css a bit more readalbe.

With in the code i changed some of the div tags to section tags to co-inside with the css folder.

I also fixed the link for online-reputation-management so that it would work when i clicked on it.

for my css stylesheet some fixes that i made to make it a little  bit easier to read where...

on the body, headers, I took the . out so the linking would work.

I added nav to my header for easier navagations to that part of page.

i changed my some of the div to sections because they had the same layout, and just combined them to one.

and same with the image tag i combined to one their were to many their with the same css layout.
